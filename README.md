Overview — Data Bridges is an initiative to enhance the regulatory efficiency and public health protection through the standardization, reconciliation, and near real-time integration of inspection data from the FDA's Office of Import Inspection (OII) and its state and foreign regulatory partners. This project aims to automate the data processing pipeline, enabling the FDA to improve decision-making, reduce redundancies, and ensure the safety of regulated products entering the U.S. market.
